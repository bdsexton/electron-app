# Electron App

**A Basic Electron App for Tinkering Purposes**

## Overview

This is just a basic Electron app for tinkering purposes. It is based on the [Electron Quick Start tutorial](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/).

## Setup

This project's **package.json** file does not currently specify any dependencies, but you will need Electron, obviously.

## Running

As you might expect, you can run the project like so:

```bash
npm start
```

That really just does this, though:

```bash
electron .
```

## Room for Improvement

Of course there is some room for improvement! At the very least I will probably add some scripts and information for the following:
* configuration
* building
