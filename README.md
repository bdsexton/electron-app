# Electron App

**A Basic Electron App for Tinkering Purposes**

## Overview

This is just a basic Electron app for tinkering purposes.

This project was started as a result of following an earlier version of the [Quick Start tutorial](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/) in the [Electron Documentation](http://electron.atom.io/docs/). It has since been updated to maintain general parity of technique with the Electron 1.0 update to the tutorial, but the project's code and content do of course differ from those in the tutorial.

## Setup

This project's **package.json** file does not currently specify any dependencies, but you will need [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), obviously.

## Running

As you might expect, you can run the project like so:

```bash
npm start
```

That really just does this, though:

```bash
electron .
```

## Room for Improvement

Of course there is some room for improvement! At the very least I will probably add some scripts and information for the following:
* configuration
* building
